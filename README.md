The purpose of this applications is to manage English phrasebooks
and load the specified English word or text into an external dictionary.

The application DOES NOT translate a text, it only loads it into an external
dictionary to get the full translation with synonyms, examples, articles etc.

The application is intended to a person who'd like to learn an English
vocabulary and widen his/her English lexicon (other languages are not supported
at this time), but his/her favorite dictionary doesn't support advanced
phrasebooks.

If your favorite dictionary supports advanced phrasebooks, then
you don't need this application.

The C++ code is heavily based on the THT code: https://github.com/HappySeaFox/tht
