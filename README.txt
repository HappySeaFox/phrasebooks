License: GNU GPLv3+ (see LICENSE.txt)

The purpose of this applications is to manage English phrasebooks
and load the specified English word or text into an external dictionary.

The application is intended to a person who'd like to learn an English
vocabulary (other languages are not supported at this time), but his/her
favorite dictionary doesn't support advanced phrasebooks (like ABBYY Lingvo).

If your favorite dictionary supports advanced phrasebooks, then
you don't need this application.

The C++ code is heavily based on the other my project
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tht.
